# Abstract
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
It is a known fact that the selection of one or more opti-mized algorithms and the configuration of significant hyperparameters, is among the major problems for the advanced data analytics using Ma-chine Learning (ML) methodologies. However, it is one of the essential tasks in order to apply the ML based solutions to deal with the real-world problems. In this regard, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a popular method for optimizing black-box functions. But, yet it is deficient for large-scale problems because it fails to leverage the knowledge from his-torical applications. The major challenge in this aspect is due to the BO waste function evaluations on bad design choices (such that the ML hy-perparameters). To address this issue, we propose to integrate Bayesian Optimization via Meta-Guidance. Consequently, Meta-Guided Bayesian Optimization (MGBO) provide means to use the knowledge from previ-ous optimization cycles on similar tasks. This capability takes the form of pre-requisite to decide the specific parts of the input space to be eval-uated next; in this regard, we intend to guide the BO with a functional ANOVA of configurations as suggested by a meta-learning process. In this paper, we demonstrate, with the help of a large collection of hyper-parameters optimization benchmark problems, that MGBO is about 3 times faster than the vanilla Bayesian optimization. Thence, it achieves a new state-of-the-art performance as proved by the experiments on 09 classification datasets.</p>
