# Abstract
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Among the key factors of Industry 4.0 are the intensive use of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs). These systems can be implemented at many application levels for various application domains. Each application requires a personalized CPS architecture concerning the Physical sensors as well as the management of Cyber systems. Furthermore, it requires also the maintenance of the communications among these different sub-systems. However, researchers and engineers may lack the essential knowledge to design and build an autonomous CPS. In this paper, we propose the concept of a novel Cyber Physical Recommendation System (CPRS) in order to address this open challenge. The proposed approach is subjected to assist the competencies of researchers and engineers to design and build more efficient CPS according to the given objective, domain, and input application scenarios. In this regard, CPRS recommend the components of the desired CPS, based on a novel architecture model of the components, connections, and tasks of the CPSs. The proposed system is eventually intended to aide the progress in leading factories towards the maturity of fourth industrial revolution.</p>
